This Email Sender is made using ssl, smpt and email.message libraries in python. It can be used to send any email to any orther email address.For obvious security reasons this program dose not use your actual email password for sending emails instead it uses a one time genereted app password (which is generated randomly by google servers).

To use this program with their own email the user have to make a few changes to the source code.

(In line 8 in the source code) The user have to put their own app password generated(see the steps below) by them in the place where it is written <#put your password here> and delete this part <#put your password here>. For Example : <#put your password here> delete this part and enter your password between the quotes

Steps to generate your own password :

Step 1 - Open your brower and visit <myaccount.google.com> (login to your account if asked)

Step 2 - Go to "Security"

Step 3 - Make sure 2-Step Verification in on (if not then enable it)

Step 4 - Click on "App passwords"

Step 5 - Enter your password to complete the verification

Step 6 - Click on "Select app"

Step 7 - From the drop down menu select "Other (Custom name)

Step 8 - Enter the name of your choice (for e.g. "python" )

Step 9 - Then click on "Generate"

Step 10 - Copy your app password and click "Done"

Your password is succesfully generated!!! Now you can use it to send emails.
