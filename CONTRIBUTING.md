# How to contribute
First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. We've tried to make a stable project and try to fix bugs and add new features continuously. You can help us do more.

## Getting started

### Check out the projects folder

We have some awesome projects available on the repository. 
If you would like to contribute some more projects which is not there in this repository , feel free to contribute. 
If you found a bug please open an issue.
We are looking for better documention and optimization of code.


### Writing some code!

Contributing to a project on Github is pretty straight forward. If this is your first time, these are the steps you should take.

- Fork this repo.

And that's it! Read the code available and change the part you don't like! Your change should not break the existing code.
 
If you're adding a new functionality, start from the branch **main**. It would be a better practice to create a new branch and work in there.

When you're done, submit a pull request and for one of the maintainers to check it out. We would let you know if there is any problem or any changes that should be considered.

### Documentation

Every chunk of code that may be hard to understand has some comments above it. If you write some new code or change some part of the existing code in a way that it would not be functional without changing it's usages, it needs to be documented.
